Goal: Merge training points exports from GEE for each year (starting with 2010 and 2012) and make cool plots of greenness time series.

```{r knitrOpts, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE, cache.path='cache/1.16_trainRRB/',
               fig.path='figure/1.16_trainRRB/')
```

**R Packages Needed**

```{r packages, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(rgdal)
```

## Load and Merge Data

```{r loadData}
# file directory and filenames
trainFolder <- 'C:/Users/deinesji/Google Drive/GEE_validation/trainingSets'
files <- list.files(trainFolder, full.names = T, pattern = '*2010')

# load and merge
trainList <- list()
for (i in 1:length(files)){
  trainList[[i]] <- read.csv(files[i]) 
}
trainAll <- do.call("rbind",trainList)
```
